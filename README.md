# Torch KB-NUFFT Demo

[API](https://torchkbnufft.readthedocs.io) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mmuckley/torchkbnufft) | [Notebook Examples](https://github.com/mmuckley/torchkbnufft/tree/master/notebooks)

This package consists of a demonstration of ```torchkbnufft```. ```torchkbnufft``` can be installed via

```sh
pip install torchkbnufft
```

The package has minimal dependencies outside of ```numpy```, ```scipy```, and ```torch```.

## Demonstration Outline

The goal of this demo is to provide examples of ```torchkbnufft```'s three main operation modes:

1. Table interpolation (default)
2. Sparse matrix interpolation
3. Toeplitz embedding interpolation

Generally, computation speed and memory cost increase from 1-3.

The demonstration is done in a Jupyter Notebook. The completed version of the notebook is in ```TorchKbNufft Demo.ipynb```, whereas ```TorchKbNufft Demo (Blank).ipynb``` has missing portions intended to be filled during a live demonstration.

The demonstration operates on a synthetic k-space data set in ```demo_data.mat```. The synthetic data set can be regenerated by running

```sh
python generate_data.py
```
